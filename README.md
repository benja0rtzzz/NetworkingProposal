# Network Infrastructure Design and Implementation for Campus Residences

This project showcases the proposal of a network infrastructure for the "Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey" on Campus Residences, focusing on transitioning from analog to IP security cameras. The project also ensures reliable connectivity for a large number of devices across multiple floors, including IP cameras, access points, and NFC readers.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Design a robust network infrastructure that supports over 2,300 devices and ensures security and reliability in a campus residential setting.
- **Scope**: The project includes the physical and logical design of the network, the implementation of VLANs, configuration of Cisco switches and routers, and real-time testing using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Key Features

- **Network Devices**:
  - Cisco switches (models: C9300-24P-E, C9300-48P-E)
  - Cisco ISR 4431 router
  - IP cameras with NVR storage
  - Access Points for resident connectivity
  - NFC readers for secure access control
- **Security Implementation**:
  - VLAN segmentation to isolate network traffic
  - SSH for secure device management
  - Physical access control to networking equipment
- **Bandwidth Optimization**:
  - Calculated bandwidth requirements based on maximum device load per resident.
  - Optimized the number of access points to avoid network congestion.
  
## Project Components

- **Packet Tracer Simulation**:
  - The `.pkt` file demonstrates the complete network setup, including routers, switches, VLAN configurations, and devices connected to the network.
